# SousChef

Ever tried to follow a recipe you found online but had to first navigate through a bunch of gibberish?  Then, when you finally get to the recipe, you can't swipe through the steps with your flour-covered hands? SousChef solves all these problems by providing you with only the information you need and you can walk through each step using voice recognition! :cake:
